## Congratulations ðŸŽ‰

Congratulations on completing the workshop! I hope you go on to build amazing websites in the future ðŸš€

Do complete any steps that you might have missed during the live workshop. For those who attended the live workshop, you have my WhatsApp and email and can reach me directly if you have any questions.

Do follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/renzil) for tweets on how to become a better coder and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/renzil) for career and industry advice.

I also write a [weekly newsletter on substack](https://renzil.substack.com) where I share powerful personal stories that have shaped the way I think and approach my career.

## Before you build or deploy this website

Make sure you replace the TENOR_API_KEY in js/game.js with your own free [API key from Tenor](https://tenor.com/developer/keyregistration) otherwise the gif images won't update.

## Next steps

Even though we implemented most of the core functionality of our game, a lot more goes into making a game (or any product) highly polished.

If you see the [original version of the game](https://hollywood-quiz.renzil.com):
- it has music and sound-effects (music has a bug where it sometimes doesn't play; just reload the page a few times)
- it shows the low-resolution gif while the high-resolution gif loads in the background, and then switches to high-res gif
- it has a confetti explosion effect every time you answer correctly
- it has a difficulty slider on the home page, so the player can play quizzes of varying difficulties
- audio and difficulty settings are passed from index.html to game.html and vice versa, to give a consistent experience to the user
- it shows a loading icon when the question is loading, and the UI is disabled to prevent bugs

These features were skipped in this workshop due to time but you can try to implement them on your own.
